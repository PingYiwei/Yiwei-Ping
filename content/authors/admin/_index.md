I am a student in Tongji University and studying for Phd. My reasearch includes steel structure design, self-centering structure å®‰and seismic  evaluation.

Except my reasearch, I am also interested in computer hardware, technology and machine learning. I may devote myself to the interdisciplinary development of computer technology and structure engineering in the future.
